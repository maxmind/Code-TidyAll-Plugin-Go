# NAME

Code::TidyAll::Plugin::Go - Provides gofmt and go vet plugins for Code::TidyAll

# VERSION

version 0.01

# SYNOPSIS

In your `.tidyallrc` file:

    [Go::Fmt]
    select = **/*.go

    [Go::Vet]
    select = **/*.go

# DESCRIPTION

This distro ships with two Go-related plugins for [Code::TidyAll](https://metacpan.org/pod/Code::TidyAll). The
`Go::Fmt` plugin formats your code with `gofmt`. The `Go::Vet` plugin runs
`go vet` against your code and dies if that command finds anything to
complain about.
